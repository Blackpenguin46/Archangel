1. Initial Analysis and Planning
• First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant
files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.

2. Architecture Reference
• The ARCHITECHTURE.md file contains detailed technical specifications
and implementation patterns that should be followed. Reference this
file for kernel module structures, C code patterns, and system design.

3. Todo List Structure
• The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off
as you complete them.

4. Plan Verification
• Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the
plan.

5. Task Execution
• Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as
complete as you go.

6. Communication
• Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation
of what changes you made.

7. Simplicity Principle
• Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want
to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should
impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

8. Process Documentation
• Every time you perform actions related to the project, append your actions
to docs/activity.md and read that file whenever you find it necessary to
assist you. Please include every prompt I give.

9. Git Repository
• Every time you make successful changes please push the changes to the
current git repository.


12. Review Process
• Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the
changes you made and any other relevant information
