4. WHEN communication between kernel and userspace occurs THEN it SHALL use shared memory ring buffers for >1M messages/sec throughput
5. WHEN kernel AI makes decisions THEN memory usage SHALL remain under 10MB and CPU usage under 5%

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security professional, I want comprehensive tool integration, so that the AI can automatically select and orchestrate appropriate security tools for each task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scanning task is required THEN the system SHALL automatically select between nmap, masscan, zmap based on speed, stealth, and thoroughness requirements
2. WHEN web application testing is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate burpsuite, zaproxy, nikto, sqlmap based on target characteristics
3. WHEN exploitation is required THEN the system SHALL utilize metasploit, custom exploits, and specialized tools as appropriate
4. WHEN OSINT is performed THEN the system SHALL orchestrate theHarvester, Shodan API, subfinder, amass, and other tools
5. WHEN tools produce output THEN the system SHALL parse results and feed them into the AI decision engine

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security professional, I want a mission control GUI interface, so that I can monitor and control AI operations in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI launches THEN it SHALL display active operations, live terminal feeds, network visualization, and results panels
2. WHEN operations are running THEN the interface SHALL show real-time progress, discovered hosts, found vulnerabilities, and tool output
3. WHEN the AI requires user input THEN the system SHALL prompt for decisions through the GUI
4. WHEN operations complete THEN results and reports SHALL be accessible through the interface
5. WHEN multiple operations run simultaneously THEN the GUI SHALL manage and display all operations concurrently

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a responsible security professional, I want the Guardian Protocol to enforce ethical boundaries, so that all operations remain authorized and legal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is initiated THEN the Guardian Protocol SHALL verify authorization for the target
2. WHEN operation scope is defined THEN the system SHALL enforce boundaries and prevent scope creep
3. WHEN potentially damaging actions are planned THEN the system SHALL block operations that could cause harm
4. WHEN operations are executed THEN the system SHALL ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
5. IF unauthorized activity is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately halt operations and log the incident

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system deployer, I want the system distributed as a fully bootable Linux distribution, so that it can be deployed on USB drives and bare metal systems without complex installation procedures.
