# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical user experience issue in the Archangel Linux interactive system where users experience workflow interruptions during target analysis. When a user requests target analysis, the system provides initial analysis but then fails to maintain the interactive session properly, jumping to different prompts instead of allowing the user to continue with follow-up questions or actions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst using Archangel, I want the interactive session to maintain context after target analysis, so that I can ask follow-up questions and continue my security assessment workflow without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests target analysis in interactive mode THEN the system SHALL complete the analysis and return to the same interactive prompt
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the analysis context for follow-up questions
3. WHEN the user wants to ask follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL reference the previous analysis in its responses
4. WHEN the user types additional commands THEN the system SHALL remain in the same interactive session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want clear continuation options after analysis completion, so that I know what actions I can take next without the session terminating unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display available next actions
2. WHEN the system shows next actions THEN it SHALL include options like "ask questions", "analyze another target", "get detailed explanation"
3. WHEN the user selects a continuation option THEN the system SHALL execute it within the same session
4. WHEN no option is selected THEN the system SHALL wait for user input rather than terminating

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to handle session state properly, so that I don't lose my analysis context when moving between different interaction modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between analysis and chat modes THEN the system SHALL preserve the current analysis context
2. WHEN an error occurs during analysis THEN the system SHALL gracefully return to the interactive prompt
3. WHEN the user interrupts analysis THEN the system SHALL handle the interruption and maintain session state
4. WHEN multiple analyses are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of previous analyses in the session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want consistent prompt behavior across all interactive modes, so that I have a predictable user experience regardless of which Archangel component I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any interactive mode THEN the system SHALL use consistent prompt formatting
2. WHEN transitioning between modes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the current mode
3. WHEN commands are available THEN the system SHALL provide consistent help and command discovery
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling and recovery options
