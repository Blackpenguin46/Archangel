## Abstract
As AI-powered security defenses become ubiquitous—from intelligent WAFs to behavioral EDR systems—a critical question emerges: what happens when AI attacks AI? This presentation introduces the first live demonstration of autonomous AI systems attacking and defeating modern AI-based security controls in real-time.

Using a novel hybrid kernel-userspace architecture, we showcase an AI attacker that generates adaptive strategies faster than AI defenders can learn, exploiting the very intelligence that makes these systems powerful. Through four dramatic scenarios—AI WAF bypass, EDR evasion, adaptive reconnaissance, and automated social engineering—attendees will witness AI vs AI combat with microsecond-precise timing and real-time strategy evolution.

This is not theoretical research. Our system demonstrates practical attacks against simulated AI-powered defenses, showing how LLM planning engines can generate SQL injection variants faster than machine learning WAFs can adapt, and how kernel-level timing can evade behavioral detection algorithms designed to catch human attackers.

The demonstration reveals a fundamental security challenge: as defenders increasingly rely on AI, attackers equipped with AI gain unprecedented advantages. We provide practical detection methodologies, defensive strategies, and open-source tools enabling security professionals to identify and counter AI-powered attacks.
