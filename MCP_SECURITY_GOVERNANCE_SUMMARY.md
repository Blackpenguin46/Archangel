   - Damage prevention checks
   - Data protection validation

3. **Authorization Validation**
   - Team authorization
   - Tool authorization
   - API authorization
   - Legal authorization
   - Data classification authorization

4. **Result Combination**
   - Most restrictive decision wins
   - Risk score aggregation
   - Compliance status merging
   - Approval requirement determination

5. **Token Generation**
   - JWT-based authorization tokens
   - Risk-based expiration times
   - Single-use for high-risk operations
   - MFA requirements

6. **Post-Processing**
   - Security alert generation
   - Threat indicator tracking
   - Audit trail creation
   - Metrics updating

### External API Security Controls
