- Kubernetes metrics (pod health, resource utilization)
- Custom business metrics (agent decisions, learning rates)

### 5. Production Deployment Tests
**File**: `infrastructure/tests/test_production_deployment.py`

**Key Features**:
- **Kubernetes deployment validation** (pod health, resource limits, HPA status)
- **Load balancing tests** (endpoint health, traffic distribution)
- **Performance testing** (response times, concurrent load handling)
- **Resource utilization monitoring** with threshold validation
- **Backup and recovery validation**
- **Monitoring system health checks**

**Test Categories**:

### 6. Automated Deployment Script
**File**: `infrastructure/scripts/deploy_production.sh`

**Key Features**:
- **Comprehensive validation** of prerequisites and configuration
- **Automated secret generation** with secure random passwords
- **Sequential deployment** with proper dependency management
- **Health checks** and validation at each step
- **Performance testing** integration
- **Deployment reporting** with detailed status information

**Deployment Workflow**:
1. Prerequisites and configuration validation
2. Namespace and RBAC setup
3. Secret creation and management
4. Storage and database deployment
5. Core service deployment
