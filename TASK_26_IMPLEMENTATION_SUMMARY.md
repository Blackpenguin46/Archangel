## Execution and Usage

### 🏃‍♂️ Running Security Validation
```bash
# Complete security validation
python security-compliance/run_security_audit.py

# Individual components
python security-compliance/security_audit_framework.py
python security-compliance/penetration_testing.py
python security-compliance/comprehensive_security_validation.py
```

### 📋 Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest security-compliance/test_security_audit.py -v

# Manual testing (if pytest unavailable)
python security-compliance/test_security_audit.py
```
