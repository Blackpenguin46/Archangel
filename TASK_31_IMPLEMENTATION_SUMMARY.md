# Task 31 Implementation Summary: Agent Memory Decay and Cognitive Modeling

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive cognitive modeling system that introduces realistic cognitive limitations, personality-driven behavior, and unpredictability to autonomous agents. This system transforms agents from deterministic scripts into psychologically realistic entities with memory decay, personality traits, and behavioral fuzzing.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Memory Decay Models ✅
**File**: `memory/cognitive_modeling.py` - `MemoryDecayModel` class

**Features Implemented**:
- **Multiple Decay Types**: Exponential, Linear, Logarithmic, Stepped, and Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve
- **Importance-Based Decay**: Important memories (high confidence, many lessons learned, MITRE mappings) decay slower
- **Recency Boost**: Recently accessed memories get strength boost to simulate rehearsal effects
- **Emotional Significance**: Emotionally significant experiences (high confidence or major failures) resist decay
- **Success Bias**: Successful experiences are remembered better than failures
- **Minimum Strength**: Memories never fully disappear, maintaining baseline accessibility

**Key Algorithms**:
```python
# Exponential decay: strength = e^(-λt) where λ = ln(2)/half_life
decay_constant = math.log(2) / half_life_hours
base_strength = math.exp(-decay_constant * age_hours)

# Final strength with all factors
final_strength = (base_strength * importance_boost * 
                 recency_boost * emotional_boost * success_boost)
```

### 2. Agent Personality Vectors ✅
**File**: `memory/cognitive_modeling.py` - `PersonalitySystem` class

**Features Implemented**:
- **8 Core Personality Traits**: Cautiousness, Aggressiveness, Stealth, Curiosity, Persistence, Adaptability, Risk Tolerance, Collaboration
- **6 Operational Styles**: Cautious, Aggressive, Stealthy, Balanced, Opportunistic, Methodical
- **Personality Consistency**: Automatic enforcement of trait relationships (e.g., high cautiousness reduces aggressiveness)
- **Experience-Based Adaptation**: Personalities evolve based on success/failure patterns
- **Behavior Modifiers**: Personality traits translate to concrete behavior modifications

**Operational Style Mappings**:
- **Stealthy**: High stealth (0.8-0.95), high cautiousness, low aggressiveness
- **Aggressive**: High aggressiveness (0.7-0.9), high risk tolerance, low cautiousness  
- **Methodical**: High persistence (0.7-0.9), high cautiousness, high collaboration
- **Opportunistic**: High adaptability (0.7-0.9), high curiosity, moderate risk tolerance

### 3. Behavior Fuzzing System ✅
**File**: `memory/cognitive_modeling.py` - `BehaviorFuzzingSystem` class

**Features Implemented**:
- **Decision Fuzzing**: Adds controlled randomness to decision scores based on cognitive state
- **Action Parameter Fuzzing**: Introduces variance in numeric action parameters (timeouts, delays, etc.)
- **Stress Amplification**: Higher stress levels increase fuzzing intensity (2.2x multiplier)
- **Fatigue Effects**: Mental fatigue increases behavioral unpredictability (1.5x multiplier)
- **Personality Influence**: Less consistent personalities show more randomness
- **Configurable Intensity**: Base randomness, noise levels, and amplifiers are all configurable

**Fuzzing Calculation**:
```python
intensity = base_randomness + 
           (stress_level * stress_amplifier * 0.1) +
           (fatigue * fatigue_amplifier * 0.1) +
           ((1.0 - attention_span) * 0.2) +
           (personality_inconsistency * personality_influence)
```

### 4. Agent Profiling System ✅
**File**: `memory/cognitive_modeling.py` - `CognitiveModelingSystem` class

**Features Implemented**:

- **Behavioral Diversity**: Agents with same role but different styles behave distinctly
- **Cognitive State Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of stress, fatigue, confidence, attention span
- **Profile Generation**: Comprehensive cognitive profiles for analysis and debugging

**Agent Profiles Include**:
- Personality traits and operational style
- Current cognitive state (stress, fatigue, confidence, attention)
- Behavior modifiers derived from personality

- Access patterns and rehearsal effects  
- Success bias and learning reinforcement

### 2. Personality-Behavior Translation
Direct mapping from abstract traits to concrete behavior modifiers:
- Aggressiveness → faster decisions, higher risk acceptance
- Stealth → preference for covert actions, lower detection risk
- Persistence → longer task duration, higher retry counts

### 3. Adaptive Fuzzing
Behavioral unpredictability that responds to:
- Cognitive load (stress, fatigue, attention)
- Individual differences (personality consistency)
- Environmental factors (team dynamics, mission pressure)

## Validation Results
