## Overview
Successfully implemented Task 35: "Create continuous learning and human-in-the-loop systems" with comprehensive knowledge distillation pipelines, human feedback integration, and automated learning policy management.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Knowledge Distillation Pipelines with Irrelevant Behavior Pruning ✅

**File**: `agents/knowledge_distillation.py`

**Key Features**:
- **BehaviorAnalyzer**: Analyzes agent experiences to identify behavior patterns
- **Multiple Distillation Types**:
  - `BEHAVIOR_PRUNING`: Removes irrelevant and harmful behaviors
  - `STRATEGY_COMPRESSION`: Compresses redundant patterns
  - `EXPERIENCE_FILTERING`: Filters experiences by relevance
  - `PATTERN_EXTRACTION`: Extracts key behavioral patterns
  - `RELEVANCE_SCORING`: Scores behavior relevance

**Behavior Pattern Analysis**:
- Groups experiences by action type and context
- Calculates success rates and frequency metrics
- Assesses relevance levels (CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, NEUTRAL, IRRELEVANT, HARMFUL)
- Generates confidence scores for patterns

**Pruning Logic**:
- Removes behaviors with low success rates
- Filters out harmful or counterproductive actions
- Incorporates human feedback to guide pruning decisions
- Maintains quality thresholds for distilled knowledge

### 2. Human-in-the-Loop Interface for Agent Action Validation and Tagging ✅

  - Timeout handling and escalation procedures

- **Feedback Types**:
  - `ACTION_VALIDATION`: Approve/reject/modify agent actions
  - `PERFORMANCE_RATING`: Rate agent performance (0.0-1.0)
  - `BEHAVIOR_TAGGING`: Tag behaviors with descriptive labels
  - `STRATEGY_CORRECTION`: Provide strategy modifications
  - `LEARNING_GUIDANCE`: Guide learning processes

- **Validation Features**:
  - Priority-based queuing (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
  - Risk assessment and impact analysis
  - Modification suggestions for rejected actions
  - Comprehensive audit trails
