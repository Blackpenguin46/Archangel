"""
AI Security Consciousness Development Demo Scenario
Demonstrates AI developing security intuitions like a human expert

This scenario shows how Archangel's AI develops "security consciousness" -
the ability to form intuitive understanding of security threats that goes
beyond rule-based detection. The AI learns to "feel" when something is wrong
and develops expert-level security intuitions.

Revolutionary Aspect: No existing security AI develops intuitions or consciousness.
They all follow pre-programmed rules and patterns.
