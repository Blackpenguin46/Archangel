Archangel Revolutionary Security Consciousness Demo
Showcase of AI that understands security rather than just automating it

This demo demonstrates the paradigm shift from "AI Security Automation" to "AI Security Consciousness":
- AI that develops intuitions about security threats
- AI that forms and tests hypotheses like a human expert
- AI that reasons across multiple modalities simultaneously
- AI that predicts threats with business context awareness
- AI that demonstrates genuine security understanding

Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions:
1. Security Consciousness vs Security Automation
2. Multi-modal reasoning vs single-modality processing
3. Hypothesis-driven investigation vs rule-based responses
4. Business-context-aware predictions vs generic threat detection
5. AI that explains its thinking vs black-box decisions
