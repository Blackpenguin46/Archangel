# Archangel Linux
## The AI Security Expert That Thinks, Learns, and Teaches

**"While others automate hacking, Archangel understands it."**

Archangel Linux is not another security automation tool - it's an **AI security expert** that thinks like a human consultant, explains its reasoning, learns from experience, and teaches users about security.

## 🧠 The Innovation

- **AI That Thinks:** Reasons about security like a senior consultant
- **AI That Explains:** Shows its thinking process and explains decisions
- **AI That Teaches:** Educational value while performing security operations
- **AI That Learns:** Improves with each operation and adapts strategies
- **AI That Converses:** Natural language discussions about security

## 🚀 Quick Start

See the planning documents to understand the vision and development approach:

- [`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) - Core vision and innovation
- [`idea.md`](idea.md) - Original concept and competitive analysis
- [`REVISED_2_WEEK_AI_CENTRIC_PLAN.md`](REVISED_2_WEEK_AI_CENTRIC_PLAN.md) - Development roadmap
- [`.kiro/specs/archangel-linux/`](.kiro/specs/archangel-linux/) - Detailed specifications

## 🎯 Development Status

**Planning Phase Complete** - Ready for implementation with Claude Code

This repository contains the planning documents and specifications needed to build Archangel Linux. The actual implementation will be done using Claude Code on Arch Linux.

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Review all planning documents
2. Set up Arch Linux development environment
3. Begin implementation following the AI-centric development plan
4. Focus on building the AI Security Expert Brain first

## 🔑 Key Differentiators

- **vs PentestGPT:** Fully autonomous, not just advisory
- **vs NodeZero:** Transparent reasoning and educational value
- **vs Commercial Tools:** Open source with conversational AI
- **vs All Others:** AI that understands security, doesn't just automate it

## 🎬 Demo Vision

The final demo will showcase an AI that:
```
User: "Analyze example.com"
AI: "Let me think systematically about this target...
🧠 This appears to be a web application
🎯 My strategy: reconnaissance → enumeration → analysis  
🤔 I'm choosing this approach because..."
```
