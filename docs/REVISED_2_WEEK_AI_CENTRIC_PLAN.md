# Archangel Linux - AI-Centric 2 Week Sprint Plan
## Building the "ChatGPT of Hacking" - The AI That Thinks Like a Security Expert

### 🧠 **Core Vision Alignment**
Based on idea.md, we're building:
- **An AI security expert that THINKS, not just executes commands**
- **Conversational AI that explains its reasoning**
- **Autonomous system that learns and adapts**
- **Educational tool that teaches while hacking**

This is **NOT** another tool wrapper - it's an **AI that understands security**.

```
User: "Analyze the security of example.com"

AI: "Let me think about this target systematically...

🧠 ANALYZING TARGET:
- Domain: example.com suggests a web presence
- I should start with reconnaissance to understand the attack surface
- My hypothesis: This is likely a web application with potential OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

🎯 MY STRATEGY:
1. DNS enumeration to find subdomains
2. Port scanning to identify services
3. Web application analysis
4. Vulnerability assessment

🤔 REASONING:
I'm choosing this approach because:
- Non-intrusive reconnaissance first (ethical)
- Build comprehensive target picture
- Prioritize web vulnerabilities (most common)

Shall I proceed with my analysis?"
```

**Demo Scenario 2: AI Adaptive Learning**
```
AI: "Interesting! I've discovered Jenkins on port 8080.

🧠 ADAPTING STRATEGY:
This changes my approach because:
- Jenkins often has authentication weaknesses
- Build artifacts might contain secrets
- CI/CD systems are high-value targets

📚 LEARNING APPLIED:
I remember from previous operations that Jenkins instances often have:
- Default credentials (admin/admin)
- Exposed build logs with credentials
- Script console access

🎯 NEW PLAN:
Switching to CI/CD-focused attack vectors..."
