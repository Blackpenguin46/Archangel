ok this is the project I need to plan out now. I'm only planning it on kiro and then developing it with claude code on my arch linux dev machine: Archangel Linux - AI-CENTRIC Build Instructions for Claude

Project Definition (AI-FOCUSED)

What we ARE building: An AI-driven autonomous security system where AI is the brain that thinks, reasons, plans, and adapts - not just a command translator. The AI makes intelligent decisions, learns from results, and can explain its reasoning.

Core AI Innovation: The AI doesn't just run tools - it thinks like a security expert, understands context, makes strategic decisions, and can explain WHY it's doing what it's doing.

Let me think about:         - What kind of target is this?         - What vulnerabilities might exist?         - What's my attack strategy?         - What tools should I use and why?         """)                  return thoughts          async def explain_reasoning(self):         """AI explains its thinking in human terms"""         return self.current_reasoning

Phase 2: Autonomous Decision Making (Days 5-7)

python

# AI makes its own decisions  class AutonomousSecurityAI:     async def execute_operation(self, objective):         """AI runs entire operation autonomously"""                  # AI decides what to do         self.think("Analyzing the objective...")         strategy = await self.create_strategy(objective)                  # AI explains its plan         await self.explain("Here's my attack strategy...")                  # AI executes with adaptation         while not self.objective_complete():             next_action = await self.decide_next_action()             result = await self.execute_action(next_action)                          # AI learns and adapts             await self.learn_from_result(result)             await self.adapt_strategy()

Phase 3: AI Conversation System (Days 8-10)

python

# AI that can discuss security intelligently  class ConversationalSecurityAI:     async def discuss(self, user_message):         """Have intelligent security conversations"""                  if "why" in user_message:             return await self.explain_reasoning()                  elif "how" in user_message:             return await self.explain_technique()                      elif "what if" in user_message:             return await self.explore_scenario()                      elif "teach me" in user_message:             return await self.educational_mode()

Phase 4: AI Learning & Adaptation (Days 11-13)

python

# AI that gets smarter  class LearningSecurityAI:     def __init__(self):         self.experience_memory = ExperienceDatabase()         self.pattern_recognizer = PatternLearner()              async def learn_from_operation(self, operation_log):         """AI learns from each security operation"""                  # Extract lessons         lessons = await self.extract_lessons(operation_log)                  # Update strategy database         await self.update_strategies(lessons)                  # Identify new patterns         patterns = await self.pattern_recognizer.analyze(operation_log)                  # Improve future performance         await self.optimize_approach(patterns)

AI Demonstration Scenarios

Scenario 1: AI Security Reasoning

User: "Analyze the security of 192.168.1.100"  AI: "Let me think about this target...      - This appears to be an internal IP address      - I should start with reconnaissance to understand what services are running      - Based on the private IP range, this might be a development server      - My strategy: Start with non-intrusive scanning, then enumerate services      - I'll look for common misconfigurations in internal systems            Shall I proceed with my analysis?"

Scenario 2: AI Adaptive Attack

AI: "I've discovered a web server on port 8080 running Jenkins.      This changes my approach because:      - Jenkins often has authentication weaknesses      - There might be exposed build artifacts      - I should check for default credentials            Adapting strategy to focus on CI/CD attack vectors..."

Scenario 3: AI Teaching Mode

User: "Teach me about SQL injection"  AI: "I'll demonstrate on this target while explaining.            SQL injection occurs when... [educational content]            Watch as I test this parameter:      - First, I'm inserting a single quote to test for errors      - Notice how the application responds differently      - This indicates potential SQL injection      - Now I'll craft a payload to extract data...            See how the database revealed information it shouldn't?"

Key AI Features to Implement

1. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

python

# AI shows its thinking process async def think_aloud(self, problem):     return await self.llm.generate(         f"Think step by step about this security problem: {problem}"     )

2. Security Knowledge Integration

python

# AI has deep security knowledge self.knowledge_base = {     "attack_patterns": MITRE_ATT&CK_patterns,     "vulnerability_types": OWASP_classifications,     "tool_capabilities": tool_knowledge_base,     "exploit_techniques": exploitation_methods }

3. Confidence Scoring

python

# AI expresses confidence in its decisions decision = {     "action": "exploit_sql_injection",     "confidence": 0.85,     "reasoning": "Multiple indicators suggest SQLi vulnerability",     "alternatives_considered": ["XSS", "Command Injection"] }

4. Learning Metrics

python

# Track AI improvement metrics = {     "successful_exploits": 45,     "patterns_learned": 123,     "strategy_adaptations": 67,     "accuracy_improvement": "+23%" }

Implementation Notes for Claude

Every output should show AI thinking - Not just results

AI explains everything - Make it educational

Show AI learning - "I've seen this pattern before..."

AI personality - Give it a security expert persona

AI confidence - Show when it's sure vs experimenting

AI Integration Points:

python

# Before ANY action ai_thought = await ai.think_about_action(action) print(f"[AI THINKING] {ai_thought}")  # After results ai_analysis = await ai.analyze_result(result) print(f"[AI ANALYSIS] {ai_analysis}")  # On failures ai_learning = await ai.learn_from_failure(error) print(f"[AI LEARNING] {ai_learning}")
